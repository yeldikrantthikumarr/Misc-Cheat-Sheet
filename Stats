These are my collection of stats formulaes, were used in my assignments:
Calculating Percentile Rank:
Formulae: 
    % Rank = [(#of values below X) + 0.5 / Total # of values] * 100
    Eg: % Rank = [2 + 0.5 / 10]*100  = 25th Percentile
 
Example 2:
    Say a candidate secured highest marks (85) and say, there are 9 students below him . (Consider a class of 10 students)
    Calculating % Rank = [9 + 0.5 / 10] *100 = 95th Percentile

LARGER SAMPLE SIZE = SMALLER STANDARD DEVIATION
2) Central Limit Theorem (Fuzzy central limit theorem):
        "Data influenced by many small and unrelated random effects are normally distributed"
        "When the number of trials and observations get very large , the data takes the shape of famous bell-curve
        "The more samples we take, the closer the means of our sample means will get to the population mean".
        " Enough random samples =  Exellent approximation of population means"
    Examples: Heat statistics in degrees, Stock market price movements    
    
3) Sampling, Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing
Confidence Interval Provides a level of confidence for a given interval

4) Standard Error: If we use larger sample sizes , standard error gets smaller 

5) Creating CI (Confidence Interval): 
Step 1: Look at (observe) Z-Scores. (Z-score --> it tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean we
would need to be to capture a certain percentage of the total distribution.
 Step 2: If sample population is = 0.55
        Upper limit = 0.55 + 1.96 (standard deviation)
        Lower limit = 0.55 - 1.96 (standard deviation)
    
6) Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis Testing is extremely popular method for exploring outcomes.
    Let us understand how statisticians usually do, 
                            1) They make an assumption
                            2) Collect random samples
                            3) Measure the samples
                            4) Make conclusion (i.e the samples makes sense or not as per his /her assumptions)
