These are my collection of stats formulaes, were used in my assignments:
Calculating Percentile Rank:
Formulae: 
    % Rank = [(#of values below X) + 0.5 / Total # of values] * 100
    Eg: % Rank = [2 + 0.5 / 10]*100  = 25th Percentile
 
Example 2:
    Say a candidate secured highest marks (85) and say, there are 9 students below him . (Consider a class of 10 students)
    Calculating % Rank = [9 + 0.5 / 10] *100 = 95th Percentile

2) Central Limit Theorem (Fuzzy central limit theorem):
        "Data influenced by many small and unrelated random effects are normally distributed"
        "When the number of trials and observations get very large , the data takes the shape of famous bell-curve
    Examples: Heat statistics in degrees, Stock market price movements    
    
3) Sampling, Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing
Confidence Interval Provides a level of confidence for a given interval
